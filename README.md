Here is an application of a interface to implement a garage door opener in java.
This interface can be intergrated with an IOT Device to control the opening and closing of two different types of Garage doors. I applied the adapter software pattern along with SOLID princples in order to deal with a situation in which we run out of objects for premiumm garage doors. A basic garage door object can be alterd to behave and open like a premium garage door. I left room for extensibliity.
